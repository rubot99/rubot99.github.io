      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the DDD North 2 event at Bradford Business School. It was another excellent event. As usual it was well organised and with an excellent line up of talks. This was my third DDD event so far and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have to admit I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go this year since I didn’t think I would be interested in many of the talk, but I’m glad I did go since some of the talks that I thought I wouldn’t be interested were really useful and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the Red Gate ‘SQL in the City’ event in London. It was one of the best free event that I have been to. The event was very well organised and had a great line up of sessions. There were three tracks of sessions DBA, Red Gate and Developer and I would have liked to attend all of them, but had to choose the ones I really wanted to attend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘Handled Unhandled Exception’ sounds like an oxy-moron, but let me explain what I mean.
I’m sure most developers have seen the code below at some point in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Microsoft Essentials as my antivirus program ever since it was released. I really like the clean and simple user interface and the small memory footprint. I also recommend it to everyone. However recently I noticed that I hadn’t run a system scan in a while and the Microsoft Essential icon had turned yellow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another post in my series of DevExpress controls that I use and like. In this post I will be looking at the ASPxGridView control. This control is one of my most used and favourite DevExpress controls. The functionality that you get straight out of the box is impressive to say the least. I’m able to add functionality that is extremely useful to the users with very little effort or code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The DevExpress ASP.Net spin editor control is one of those simple but extremely useful controls. I tend to use this control a lot in my projects. It basically is a text input field which only allows the user to enter numeric data.
I know on the face of it does not seem revolutionary, but a few things I like about the control are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using the DevExpress WinForms &amp;amp; ASP.Net controls at work. I have been surprised by the many useful features that you get straight out of the box. I mostly work with the ASP.Net controls, but recently I have been using the DevExpress TreeList WinForm controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the Developer, Developer, Developer event in Glasgow. It was the first time I have been to a DDD event and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The event was well organised and the content in the sessions were excellent. The event thoroughly exceeded my expectations. There were so many interesting sessions that if I had the chance I would have attended them all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have wanted to use a distributed source control management tool at work. I have looked at both Mercurial and Git and decided that I would like try Mercurial. So recently I have had the opportunity to use Mercurial on a new project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
