      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another post in my series of DevExpress controls that I use and like. In this post I will be looking at the ASPxGridView control. This control is one of my most used and favourite DevExpress controls. The functionality that you get straight out of the box is impressive to say the least. Iâ€™m able to add functionality that is extremely useful to the users with very little effort or code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using the DevExpress WinForms &amp;amp; ASP.Net controls at work. I have been surprised by the many useful features that you get straight out of the box. I mostly work with the ASP.Net controls, but recently I have been using the DevExpress TreeList WinForm controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
