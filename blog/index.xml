      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Soft Skills: The Software Developer&amp;rsquo;s Life Manual&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; is a book written by John Somnez, I first heard of John on the Dot Net Rocks podcast. After that I started to following his fitness podcast Get UP and Code. Nowadays I mainly follow him on his YouTube channel â€˜Simple Programmerâ€™.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;â€˜The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Winâ€™&lt;/strong&gt; is a book about common situations you face working on software projects. The book teaches concepts and ideas through story form, it is very similar to books like the â€˜One minute managerâ€™ and â€˜The richest man in Babylonâ€™. Iâ€™ve read both these books and enjoyed how the simple truths and ideas are very cleverly conveyed through the story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The art of discarding is about mainly changing our mind set so that we have a positive attitude towards discarding items that we donâ€™t use. The book goes through attitudes and strategies to discard items by giving different scenarios and how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review - Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code - Part 3</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-3&#34;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is all about various code smells and how we can try to identify them.
The first code smell is duplicated code. Duplicated code means more places to make code changes and higher risks of bugs being added. The best way to fix this issue is to either extract the code into a new method or into a different class.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals-of-refactoring&#34;&gt;Goals of refactoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring code makes a code base easier to understand and modify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring does not change observable the observable behaviour of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m an avid listener of the CodingBlocks.Net podcasts and itâ€™s been one of my go to podcasts for software development. I have especially enjoyed the podcasts where the presenters reviewed the Clean Code book by having a podcast per chapter where they discussed their individual thoughts. So I thought I would follow their idea and write blogs posts reviewing Martin Fowlerâ€™s book on Refactoring. This year I wanted to read a few software development books and write a few posts, so what better way to merge my two goals reading the book and writing posts for the sections/chapters ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another of my new year resolutions is to read three computer science related books. So, the first book I choose was Kent Beckâ€™s book on TDD. I would say this book is the quintessential book on test driven development. I have owned this book for quite a few years but have never gotten around to reading it. So finally, I have taken plunge and have completed reading the book ðŸ˜Š.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first decided to blog, I investigated a few platforms. I wanted something that allowed me to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create posts easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility with theme and other advanced features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low cost/Free&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the DDD North 2 event at Bradford Business School. It was another excellent event. As usual it was well organised and with an excellent line up of talks. This was my third DDD event so far and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have to admit I wasnâ€™t sure if I wanted to go this year since I didnâ€™t think I would be interested in many of the talk, but Iâ€™m glad I did go since some of the talks that I thought I wouldnâ€™t be interested were really useful and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the Red Gate â€˜SQL in the Cityâ€™ event in London. It was one of the best free event that I have been to. The event was very well organised and had a great line up of sessions. There were three tracks of sessions DBA, Red Gate and Developer and I would have liked to attend all of them, but had to choose the ones I really wanted to attend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;â€˜Handled Unhandled Exceptionâ€™ sounds like an oxy-moron, but let me explain what I mean.
Iâ€™m sure most developers have seen the code below at some point in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Microsoft Essentials as my antivirus program ever since it was released. I really like the clean and simple user interface and the small memory footprint. I also recommend it to everyone. However recently I noticed that I hadnâ€™t run a system scan in a while and the Microsoft Essential icon had turned yellow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the Web Fuelled Business event at Castle Gate, Newcastle upon Tyne. This event was organised by the School for Startups. The speakers were Doug Richard and James Dening (click here for information on the speakers). In my opinion the event was very well organised and I did take away quite a bit from the sessions. The Castle Gate venue was a wonderful venue and the venue staffs were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another post in my series of DevExpress controls that I use and like. In this post I will be looking at the ASPxGridView control. This control is one of my most used and favourite DevExpress controls. The functionality that you get straight out of the box is impressive to say the least. Iâ€™m able to add functionality that is extremely useful to the users with very little effort or code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The DevExpress ASP.Net spin editor control is one of those simple but extremely useful controls. I tend to use this control a lot in my projects. It basically is a text input field which only allows the user to enter numeric data.
I know on the face of it does not seem revolutionary, but a few things I like about the control are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Couple of weeks ago I came across this post on the engadget website about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/2011/07/18/robot-band-covers-marilyn-manson-renders-sullen-teenagers-obsol/&#34;&gt;robotic band called â€˜End of Lifeâ€™&lt;/a&gt;.
The video shows the band covering â€˜The Beautiful Peopleâ€™ by Marilyn Manson. I thought it was extremely cool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of months I have been getting into iPhone photography or as it is more popularly known as iPhoneography.
I started out by using Instagram and have now graduated to using both Instagram and Hipstamatic.
At first glance I thought these apps were similar and favoured Instagram because of its ease of use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using the DevExpress WinForms &amp;amp; ASP.Net controls at work. I have been surprised by the many useful features that you get straight out of the box. I mostly work with the ASP.Net controls, but recently I have been using the DevExpress TreeList WinForm controls.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the Developer, Developer, Developer event in Glasgow. It was the first time I have been to a DDD event and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The event was well organised and the content in the sessions were excellent. The event thoroughly exceeded my expectations. There were so many interesting sessions that if I had the chance I would have attended them all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time I have wanted to use a distributed source control management tool at work. I have looked at both Mercurial and Git and decided that I would like try Mercurial. So recently I have had the opportunity to use Mercurial on a new project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my final post on my personal backup strategy. In this post I am going to state which service I decided to go with.
At the end of my last post I couldnâ€™t decide between Backblaze and Mozy since I liked both backup services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This second post is to clarify questions I had about some of the cloud based backup solutions. I havenâ€™t tried out Jungle Disk, since the pay as you use storage costs would be too expensive for me. Also with Jungle Disk you would need to pay for the product and the storage costs. This would be expensive for me and so havenâ€™t investigated the service further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>/blog/quest-personal-backup-strategy-part1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that I am continuously trying to improve my backup strategy. From my experience I believe that a backup strategy will evolve as your needs change and a one size fits all doesnâ€™t really work. So for this reason I am always asking people how they backup their important data and reading blog posts on peopleâ€™s backup strategies. All this helps me to refine my backup strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
