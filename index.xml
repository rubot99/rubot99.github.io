      <title>Review - The Phoenix Project</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/09/review---the-phoenix-project/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win’&lt;/strong&gt; is a book about common situations you face working on software projects. The book teaches concepts and ideas through story form, it is very similar to books like the ‘One minute manager’ and ‘The richest man in Babylon’. I’ve read both these books and enjoyed how the simple truths and ideas are very cleverly conveyed through the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book starts with a story of a fictitious company that is a market leader in their field, however in the last couple of years their competitors have been over taking them. The company has a new software project that will help them regain their pole position, but due to development issues they have been unable to deliver the product. In the book, we follow the acting CIO and problems he faces taking up this new role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-first-part-of-the-book-discusses-issues&#34;&gt;The first part of the book discusses issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of communication between development, infrastructure and testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor estimates for work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poor software processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No change request process or change authorisation process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No priority for tasks and a lack of a complete task list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work politics - issues with Senior management and other teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latest technology won’t fix process issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caught in the cycle of delivering features without considering risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All tasks cannot have the highest priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem with always being in firefighting mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different types of work i.e. Business projects, Internal projects, Change request and unplanned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unplanned work is the most destructive type of work, often considered anti-work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;second-half-of-the-book-discusses-concepts-and-ideas&#34;&gt;Second half of the book discusses concepts and ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t sort the strategic until you sort the tactical&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having transparency is good but allowing generals access to every private can have a detrimental effect on the war effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a proper and planned change request process is very important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing work tracking is important&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding your bottlenecks will help you have a steady flow of work and also planning work order and priority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outsource work but not responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT is a core of the business not a cost centre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technical debt that is not paid down, compounds interest in the long run in the form on unplanned work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduced deployment times helps increase the number of deployments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing human interventions during deployment ensure that we can consistency reproduce deployments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-book-concludes-with-the-team-implementing&#34;&gt;The book concludes with the team implementing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planned and approved change request process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation of Agile and Kanban&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased communication and transparency between teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removal of knowledge bottlenecks through knowledge based systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated deployments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to cloud based systems&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Review - Art of Discarding</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/08/review---art-of-discarding/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 31 Aug 2017 17:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/08/review---art-of-discarding/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The art of discarding is about mainly changing our mind set so that we have a positive attitude towards discarding items that we don’t use. The book goes through attitudes and strategies to discard items by giving different scenarios and how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the book discusses the Japanese concept of Mottani, which the shame associated with wastefulness. In the past things were precious people looked after and used their possessions. Often after an item lost it’s purpose, people tended to find new ways of re-purposing it’s purpose.
However today there has been a switch from an era were things were precious to a point where everything is in abundance. With the market being flooded with new things, we have changed to view that new is always better. We are drowning in stuff because we are not buying possessions because we need them but because we want them. We are buying more stuff but because of our in grained view of Mottani, we are not discarding things as fast as we are buying them. We need a positive attitude to discarding, instead of thinking of discarding as wastefulness, we need to look at it as a way of assessing the value of things. We must not fall into the trap of thinking that not throwing something away is that same as looking after it. We need to remember that ‘Keep things you use and discard things you don’t’. The best way to cherish something is to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;attitudes-that-prevent-us-from-discarding&#34;&gt;Attitudes that prevent us from discarding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t keep items for now - Discard it right away because you will end getting rid of things in the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid temporary storage because those places tend to become permanent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some time never comes - items like clothes are kept because some time you could use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying things for convenience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing is sacred - If you own an item, you should use it, if you don’t use it then don’t have it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage and organisational methods are not the solution to discarding items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategies-to-help-in-dicarding&#34;&gt;Strategies to help in dicarding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When something catches your attention ask your self can you get rid of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discard things as soon as you receive them - Don&amp;rsquo;t keep them to discard later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give away things you don’t need to someone who will want and appreciate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you have excess of a certain item, get rid of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discard items when you have not used them after a period of time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit the space you have for items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have not completely used something get rid of it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set criteria for disposal and do not give any item special exemptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign responsibility for disposal of an area or items to particular person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Review - Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code - Part 3</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/08/review---refactoring---improving-the-design-of-existing-code---part-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Aug 2017 21:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-3&#34;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This chapter is all about various code smells and how we can try to identify them.
The first code smell is duplicated code. Duplicated code means more places to make code changes and higher risks of bugs being added. The best way to fix this issue is to either extract the code into a new method or into a different class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switch statements are another code smell. Switch statements often have a lot of duplicated code. Use polymorphism to replace switch statements.
Long methods are another code smell. Long methods make it difficult to understand the purpose of the code. Long methods always end up doing more than one thing, methods should have one responsibility (SRP). This makes it easier to understand the code and modify in the future. Good naming of methods helps a reader understand the purpose of the method. Modern languages have eliminated the overhead of in process calls, allowing smaller methods without effecting performance. Another good rule of thumb is that blocks of code that need comments are ideal candidates for decomposing into smaller methods. Large classes should also be decomposed into sub classes or extracted into other classes. Methods with long parameter lists should be reduced for readability by using objects instead.
So far we have mentioned splitting classes and methods, but sometimes you will need to merge classes and methods. This will help to bring methods that have similar purposes to be together, making it easier to modify and understand.
If there are classes that only pass information from one class to a client, then it might be worth removing the middleman class. Remove unwanted abstraction that is not required. Temporary fields are also another form of code smell and make code to be difficult to debug and modify. Data model class might be considered also as code smells. Poor inheritance is a code smell this is where class inherits behaviours from a super class that it does not require. Classes that overly use another classes private methods and variable is a break of the encapsulation rule. Finally comments can be a code smell, instead of simplifying complex code the use of comments is a way to allow the reader to understand it better. Often code is modified but the comments aren’t which will causes further complications for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review - Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/08/review---refactoring---improving-the-design-of-existing-code---part-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2&#34;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;goals-of-refactoring&#34;&gt;Goals of refactoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring code makes a code base easier to understand and modify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring does not change observable the observable behaviour of the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;refactoring-improves-design&#34;&gt;Refactoring improves design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorly designed code adds complexity and increase the number of lines of code required to achieve the same functionality. An important aspect of improving design is to eliminate duplicate code. Reducing the number of lines of code helps in future modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code should easily communicate its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring helps achieve robust and scalable code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good design is vital for agile and fast software development. Teams can progress with a poorly designed code base for a period but eventually it catches up to the team and slows them down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refactoring should be done in short bursts instead of large chunks. Follow the boy scout rule and leave code that you have touched in a better state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;refactoring-problem-areas&#34;&gt;Refactoring problem areas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Databases are often difficult to refactor without causing major outages for a business or without writing extra code to work around refactored areas so to maintain existing behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorly designed interfaces are difficult to change, since the team might not have access to all code bases that implement the interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Review - Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/08/review---refactoring---improving-the-design-of-existing-code---part-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2017 20:30:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m an avid listener of the CodingBlocks.Net podcasts and it’s been one of my go to podcasts for software development. I have especially enjoyed the podcasts where the presenters reviewed the Clean Code book by having a podcast per chapter where they discussed their individual thoughts. So I thought I would follow their idea and write blogs posts reviewing Martin Fowler’s book on Refactoring. This year I wanted to read a few software development books and write a few posts, so what better way to merge my two goals reading the book and writing posts for the sections/chapters 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;foreword-preface-chapter-1&#34;&gt;Foreword + Preface + Chapter 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first section talks about the importance of designing software before you start implementation. Good design is no substitute for immediate implementation gratification. Putting coding first is a sure way of spiralling from engineering to code hacking. Poor design reduces the readability and maintainability of your code. It is said code is read and modified more frequently than it is written. Poorly designed code bases often suffer from copy and paste code rather than reusable modules. This all makes code difficult to maintain and increasing the chances of adding bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlled refactoring is the way to improve an existing code base that might be poorly designed or one that has accumulated cruft over time. Refactoring is not a magic bullet but also has risks involved. Any modification to a code base has the potential to introduce bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One preliminary step you need to take before starting any refactoring is to have a comprehensive suite of tests. This ensures that existing functionality is not broken during the refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is to decompose things into smaller parts and to refactor. It is difficult to refactor large parts but is more manageable to refactor smaller parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renaming functions and variables are an important step. Good code should communicate its intent without the need of extra documentation. Readable code might initially seem less performant, but in the long run it will be easier to change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review - Test Driven Development by Example</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/04/review---test-driven-development-by-example/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/04/review---test-driven-development-by-example/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another of my new year resolutions is to read three computer science related books. So, the first book I choose was Kent Beck’s book on TDD. I would say this book is the quintessential book on test driven development. I have owned this book for quite a few years but have never gotten around to reading it. So finally, I have taken plunge and have completed reading the book 😊.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is under two hundred pages long and my initial impression was that it was an introductory style book for TDD. After reading the book, I’ve realised it’s a lot more. The book is divided into three sections. The first section goes through the process of building new functionality into an existing software product using the TDD method. It takes you through all the steps and shows the pitfalls you might encounter. The main purpose of the scenario is to teach you the concepts with an example that will be easy to understand. It hammers home the importance of taking small test while writing new tests and writing enough code to make your tests pass. Following the write-run-refactor mantra is important and it also shows that taking bigger code steps might actually be counterproductive in the long run. I think as developers we are often too eager to sling code but the TDD process does force you to think before you leap. The second section goes through the process of setting you environment and testing framework. The third section I found very interesting, it’s more of a reference section. I can see myself referring to that section a lot more in the future. It covers patterns and practices for TDD and refactoring and design patterns in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the book I appreciate the importance of taking smaller steps in code when doing TDD. I understand the reason behind writing enough code to make your test pass, since it prevents from over engineering your problem and falling into the YAGNI trap. Overall I think this book is good to help you get into the TDD mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experiments with Blogging Platforms</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/03/experiments-with-blogging-platforms/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2017/03/experiments-with-blogging-platforms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first decided to blog, I investigated a few platforms. I wanted something that allowed me to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create posts easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility with theme and other advanced features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low cost/Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After investigating, I settled with WordPress.com , it had all the features that I was looking for from a blogging platform and more. I used WordPress.com for about two years, then got a bit busy with other stuff and slowly stopped blogging all together.
This year I decided that I should get back into blogging and one of my resolutions for the year is to write a minimum of 12 blog posts. So this post is the first of my posts, so one down and eleven to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;revisit-current-setup&#34;&gt;Revisit current setup&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To kick start blogging, I decided to look at other blogging platforms and make some changes to my current blog. I found that I wasn’t really using all the features I got with WordPress.com. I had heard of Ghost and was looking at that platform. I liked the clean minimalist look of most of the Ghost themes and was interested in using markdown to write my posts. While investigating the Ghost platform and hosting options, I came across GitHub pages and Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/wordpressBlog.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;rubot blog&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h4 id=&#34;github-pages-and-jekyll&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages and Jekyll&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started investigating GitHub user pages, the thought of having a github.io domain sounded really interesting and using the same tools &amp;amp; processes that I use to develop for blogging was appealing. Being a Windows user, I had few problems running my Jekyll site on my machine. I finally decided to just fork a theme and gave up on running the site locally. I did have a few problems with some of themes I forked. After looking at few themes, I finally settled on the ‘minimal mistakes’ theme, it worked really well, had a clean design and good documentation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/jekyll.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Jekyll static site generator&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h4 id=&#34;github-pages-and-hugo&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages and Hugo&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after building the blog using Jekyll, I was doing some research and came across Hugo. Hugo is a static site generator and I decided to play around with it. Hugo is a cross platform application and coupled with the good documentation it was very easy to get started using Hugo. I selected a theme and got building a Hugo site. Once I built the Hugo site, I started looking at deploying my site to GitHub user pages. The Hugo documentation has a tutorial on building and deploying your site using a tool called Wercker. Wercker is a CI tool and it was really easy to get it all set up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/hugo.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Hugo static site generator&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-process&#34;&gt;The Process&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after all the investigation and testing, I finally settled on using Hugo to build my site and Wercker to deploy the site to my GitHub user pages. I’ve got two repositories my user pages repo that holds the generated files and a repo to hold the site code. As soon as I commit and push changes to my site, Wercker will build the site and deploy the generated site to my user pages repo. I will agree it seems a lot of work for publishing a post, but as a developer this process is second nature to the way I work on a daily basis. Also through all the testing I’ve got to use Visual Studio Code, Atom and Git Kraken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been about 4 years since I last blogged, stuff has got in the way and I have just not been bothered. Anyway this year I want to start blogging again – a hello world reboot ;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this year one my resolutions has been to write twelve blog post by December 2017. Hopefully by the end of the year I would have achieved this goal. I’m going to try and blog on technology, development and my experience on keto.
To kick start my blogging goal I decided to use a new blogging platform. I’ve got my new blog all set up now. So I guess rubot is locked and loaded :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the DDD North 2 event at Bradford Business School. It was another excellent event. As usual it was well organised and with an excellent line up of talks. This was my third DDD event so far and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have to admit I wasn’t sure if I wanted to go this year since I didn’t think I would be interested in many of the talk, but I’m glad I did go since some of the talks that I thought I wouldn’t be interested were really useful and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an early start on Saturday with a few minor car troubles, which was sorted out quite quickly. I got to the event a little before registration and the venue was very nice. Once there I grabbed a coffee and scouted out the rooms where the talks were being held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sessions I finally decided on where:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;windows-8-apps-mike-taulty&#34;&gt;‘Windows 8 Apps’ – Mike Taulty&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very good session introducing both Windows 8 and Windows 8 app development. I really liked the touch screen Mike was using for his demos. It got me really interested in Windows 8 and WinRT app development. All I need now is to update my 5 year old PC and install Windows 8 &amp;amp; VS 2012 on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;async-c-5-0-patterns-for-real-world-use-liam-westley&#34;&gt;‘Async C# 5.0 – Patterns for real world use’ – Liam Westley&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have attended other talks by Liam and have always found his talks to be very interesting and the subject matter always useful. This was one of the talks I wasn’t really interested in, but was pleasantly surprised that it was one of the best talks I attended during the event. It was very interesting and as Liam was going through his demos I could see places in my own projects where I could use the Async patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;selenium-a-ui-testing-paradigm-nathan-gloyn&#34;&gt;‘Selenium a UI testing paradigm’ – Nathan Gloyn&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have attended two other talks by Nathan, SOLID principle and Kanban which were both excellent talks. Since I have heard about Selenium, but never really investigated it. I thought this might be a good introduction. The talk was very good, Nathan explained how to use the Selenium IDE and WebDriver for creating automated regression tests.

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;web-sockets-and-signalr-building-the-real-time-interactive-web-chris-alcock&#34;&gt;‘Web Sockets and SignalR – Building the Real Time Interactive Web’ – Chris Alcock&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting talk and a good introduction to the topic. I haven’t really looked a lot into web sockets which could be due to my limited javascript knowledge, however I think its something I want to investigate further. The SignalR project actually looks really good and I think I might be able to use it in a couple applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;c-powershell-happy-couple-jimmy-skowronski&#34;&gt;‘C# + PowerShell = happy couple’ – Jimmy Skowronski&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been wanting to investigate and learn PowerShell , so when I saw this talk on the list I decided it would a good introduction to the subject area. Jimmy did a great job with the talk and I need to spend some time investigating PowerShell and creating power shell command in c#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a Grok talk on OutSystems which looked really interesting and would be very useful in rapidly building/prototyping business application. I think it would be really useful in my current company since we sometime need to quickly build applications with a limited shelf life. These ‘limited shelf life’ applications tend be used for 3 -6 months and after that won’t be required. Also these application need to be built very quickly; often we may have a couple of days to deploy it. I’m going to have a look at OutSystems and LightSwitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it was an excellent event and I took away a lot from the session. I am definitely going to use the Async patterns within my applications in the future and am going to look more into PowerShell and WinRT applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Red Gate Sql In The City London</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/07/red-gate-sql-in-the-city-london/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/07/red-gate-sql-in-the-city-london/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the Red Gate ‘SQL in the City’ event in London. It was one of the best free event that I have been to. The event was very well organised and had a great line up of sessions. There were three tracks of sessions DBA, Red Gate and Developer and I would have liked to attend all of them, but had to choose the ones I really wanted to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately for me the great folks at Red Gate recorded all the sessions and announced that they would be made available for all the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started off with a cup of coffee in one of the best mugs ever!!! It was a mug with the top SQL Prompt snippets and I have to admit I didn’t know some of them. I am happy to report that those snippets are now being used extensively :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was kicked off by the welcome session from Simon Galbraith (Joint CEO of Red Gate). He discussed past Red Gate products and how getting customer feedback early in the development process had a significant impact on the commercial success of the products. I guess you could sum what he said to ‘Release soon, Release Often’ equals greater chance for commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared off with ‘Top Tips for Writing Better – T-SQL stored procedures’. This session was run by Grant Fritchey (ScaryDBA.com). I was quite surprised at how making a few changes to your query could improve it’s performance. It was a really good session for anyone who writes a bit of T-SQL, especially if you are writing queries against a legacy database that wasn’t designed well :(.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then attended the ‘Prepare for When disaster Strikes’, which was run by Steve Jones, Editor in Chief at SQLServerCentral.com. The session was targeted at DBAs, but as a developer the main thing I got was the importance of increasing your alert time since this gives you more time to react to a problem. I do see the benefit of this since I use Elmah in my web applications and getting a heads up before a user calls me has been extremely useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I attended ‘Deployment Horrors and How to avoid them’ by Dave Ballantyne and followed that with ‘Case Study – How we learned to stop worrying and love Continuous Integration’ by Dave Green and Annette Allen from First Databank. For the final session I thought I would try a wild card session and went to the ‘SQL Azure from Plan, to Backup, to Cloud – Red Gate Cloud-Ready Services’. This session was run by Tobiasz Koprowski and Richard Mitchell. I was really surprised how much I liked the session. It was well presented and Tobiasz and Richard did a really great job. I had the misconception of thinking that Azure was SQL server in the cloud, unfortunately there are limitation to having SQL server in the cloud and these limitation aren’t only technical and can be geographic laws. Using Azure depends on the type of application your building and the data you will be storing, some applications are better suited for Azure than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall it was a great event and I really enjoyed it and will definitely be looking out for the next ‘SQL in the City’ event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Handled Unhandled Exceptions</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/07/handled-unhandled-exceptions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/07/handled-unhandled-exceptions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘Handled Unhandled Exception’ sounds like an oxy-moron, but let me explain what I mean.
I’m sure most developers have seen the code below at some point in their careers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
try
{
//code that does something
}
catch(Exception exc)
{}

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think the catch section is missing some code your absolutely correct. Unfortunately I have seen this type of code quite a few times. This type of error handling is what I like to call a handled unhandled exception, the major problem here is that any unhandled exception is caught but nothing is ever done with it. It’s a nightmare to debug this kind of code because you never know whether the code returns no results or there was an exception thrown. In a real world application this code would be called by other functions which might also have the same style of exceptional handling and this turns out to be extremely difficult to debug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I would prefer that the developer wouldn’t wrap the code with a try and catch or atleast re-throw the exception.
In my opinion if you are going to handle an exception, handle them properly don’t just pseudo handle them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Intuitive User Interface Design Actually Subjective</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/05/is-intuitive-user-interface-design-actually-subjective/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/05/is-intuitive-user-interface-design-actually-subjective/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using Microsoft Essentials as my antivirus program ever since it was released. I really like the clean and simple user interface and the small memory footprint. I also recommend it to everyone. However recently I noticed that I hadn’t run a system scan in a while and the Microsoft Essential icon had turned yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I opened Microsoft Essentials, the main window had a large yellow ‘Scan Now’ button. Since I hadn’t run a system scan for a while, I thought I should run a full scan instead of a quick scan. So I selected full scan from the scan options and then clicked the yellow ‘Scan Now’ button. What I expected to happen now was that Microsoft Essentials would start a full system scan, however what happened was a quick scan was started. This surprised me and at first I assumed that I had made a mistake. So after investigating this for a few weeks I realised that when you click the yellow ‘Scan Now’ button it always starts a quick scan regardless of what scan option was selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought this wasn’t intuitive, but after thinking about it more I started to wonder, if actually intuitiveness was subjective. Would another user actually expect that the application would run a quick scan when they clicked on the yellow ‘Scan Now’ button regardless of the scan option selected? Is there enough of a distinction between the regular scan now section and high priority yellow ‘Scan Now’ button to explain the difference of scan types that will be executed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was designing this process what I would do is check the scan type selected and run that particular scan. I agree that when a system scan hasn’t been run for a long time you would want to alert the user (large yellow button) and you would want the user to run a complete system scan. Running a quick system scan makes sense since it would take less time to complete and on a psychological level there is a higher probability that the scan would complete before the user decided to cancel it. I think this could be achieved by the fact that the quick scan is selected by default in the scan options section and if the user has made the decision to perform a full scan they expect it will take longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be quite interested in what anyone else thinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are screenshots of my process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Microsoft Essentials when the icon has turned yellow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/sc12.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main window opens with the large yellow ‘Scan Now’ button visible and the quick scan option is selected by default. I then select the full scan option and click the yellow ‘Scan Now’ button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/sc2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/sc3.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You notice that a quick scan has been started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/sc4.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After cancelling the scan I made sure the full scan option was selected and then clicked on the regular scan now button. This time a full scan is started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/sc5.jpg&#34; /&gt;

      <title>Web Fuelled Business Event</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/03/web-fuelled-business-event/</link>

      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2012/03/web-fuelled-business-event/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attended the Web Fuelled Business event at Castle Gate, Newcastle upon Tyne. This event was organised by the School for Startups. The speakers were Doug Richard and James Dening (click here for information on the speakers). In my opinion the event was very well organised and I did take away quite a bit from the sessions. The Castle Gate venue was a wonderful venue and the venue staffs were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire event was held in the Turbine Hall. I got to the venue quite early so I did get to sit up front and got some pictures of Doug and James during their sessions. I enjoyed all the session and can’t really pick out a particular session that I really liked best.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/dougrichard.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Doug Richard&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things James discussed in his session on market places was scaling your business using Amazon’s delivery system. This was something that was totally new to me. James explained that Amazon will store and ship your products that have been sold through their Marketplace. He also discussed how he uses the Amazon delivery service for products bought from his Amazon Marketplace. I couldn’t believe what an amazing service Amazon provides for its sellers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://rubot99.github.io/images/jamesdening.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;James Dening&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There were certain things that were said that really caught my attention, they were
1. An entrepreneur has to stop being an inventor and move to put things around that idea to build a business – As a software developer I can really relate to this. I often find myself excited about the technology or architecture of a system and forget about the selling of that product or service.
2. Low prices and large selection are essential for e-commerce websites.
3. Sacrifice short term profits for long term customer retention. – I guess ‘The Customer is still King’
4. Being on Page 2 of a Google search result is like being in Internet Siberia – This really brings home the point how much search engines impact our browsing of the internet.
5. The war of the click is greater than the war of price. – Reduce the barriers to your site. Too many clicks are just too much effort.
6. Video testimonials on your website have a great impact on your customer’s selection process and are anxiety reducers. Your landing page should have anxiety reducers for your site visitors to help increase their trust in your site.
7. Social media is the Amplification of word of mouth.
8. Don’t create obstacles to outcomes. – This really hit home for me and I started to think about how I have created obstacles in other areas to prevent successful outcomes.
Overall it was an excellent event and I would definitely recommend it to anyone else. Also I would definitely attend the next Web Fuelled event in Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Devexpress Gridview Control</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2011/08/using-devexpress-gridview-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2011/08/using-devexpress-gridview-control/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another post in my series of DevExpress controls that I use and like. In this post I will be looking at the ASPxGridView control. This control is one of my most used and favourite DevExpress controls. The functionality that you get straight out of the box is impressive to say the least. I’m able to add functionality that is extremely useful to the users with very little effort or code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features that I like in the control are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default themes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data sorting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data grouping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colum re-arrangement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features that I have listed are features that come straight out the box. I tend to normally bind the GridView to a list of business objects and either enable or disable the features through the control markup. I find these features really useful since I don’t need to write extra code on the application side nor do I have any additional views or stored procedures
on the database side. I should mention that depending on what you do with data editing you make need to handle row events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features that I like the best is the data grouping functionality and the reason for this is that it allows users to group on any column they need to. The first screen shot shows the default gridview without any grouping. The second screen shot shows what happens when the user groups on one of the columns and the third screen shot shows what happens when the grouping is on two different columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Using DevExpress ASP.Net Spin Editor Control</title>
      <link>https://rubot99.github.io/2011/08/using-devexpress-asp.net-spin-editor-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://rubot99.github.io/2011/08/using-devexpress-asp.net-spin-editor-control/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The DevExpress ASP.Net spin editor control is one of those simple but extremely useful controls. I tend to use this control a lot in my projects. It basically is a text input field which only allows the user to enter numeric data.
I know on the face of it does not seem revolutionary, but a few things I like about the control are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small and large increment buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control features can be setup through markup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control value can be retrieved as either a string or int/decimal value (this saves writing code that casts to a string or int/decimal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the markup for the spin edit control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;dx:ASPxSpinEdit ID=&amp;quot;dxspinAmount&amp;quot; runat=&amp;quot;server&amp;quot; Height=&amp;quot;21px&amp;quot; Number=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; NumberType=&amp;quot;Integer&amp;quot; Increment=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot; AllowNull=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; Enabled=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; &amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;SpinButtons Position=&amp;quot;Left&amp;quot; ShowLargeIncrementButtons=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/SpinButtons&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dx:ASPxSpinEdit&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
